- There are three types of VPC endpoints: 
  - Interface endpoints: These endpoints are powered by Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). They can be used to access services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon Kinesis Data Streams.
  - Gateway endpoints: These endpoints are used for traffic destined for a supported AWS service. They currently support S3 and DynamoDB services.
  - Gateway load balancer endpoints
